# firenodejs
Control FireStep factory robots from your browser or REST application.
Since **firenodejs** integrates motion with vision in a single web application,
it is an essential building block for applications such as Pick and Place (PnP).
These applications need vision to coordinate their actions and **firenodejs**
provides a single node of control for multiple applications.

* Send motion commands to a FireStep robot 
* Access the camera feed of a Raspberry Pi camera (if available) or a USB camera
* Perform vision processing

### Install
